    So the homework is somewhat self-explanatory. The only somewhat ambiguous part is the
CardFactory class, that converts a raw card to a Card object.
    Apart from that it's pretty straightforward, you can find small comments and a somewhat detailed
description in the method's javadoc. The method does what it says (apart from shalom who is a name
I picked in a moment of crisis, and I decided to leave it as a monument to my stupidity).
    I think it could be improved more visually, but as long as it looks decent and it works I'm fine
with it. It's not really worth the time to split longer methods into smaller ones, because it
doesnt really make it more readable, and it's not like it's a huge project. I think it's pretty
much done, but if you have any suggestions I'm open to them.
    Stay classy :P
